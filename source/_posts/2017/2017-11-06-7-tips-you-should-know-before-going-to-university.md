title: "7 Tips You Should Know Before Going To University"
perex: '''
    It's been four years since I finished college without me for it gave title. During those four years, my college asked people that I can count on the fingers of one hand. And the title? Not one. 
    <br><br>
    **I recently called to one school and I realized that college is still seen as something sacred, important and mostly without insight anyone other than teachers and parents**. I told myself that I'll write my insights and advice that I would very much like to give 8 years ago. **If you are 18-19 years're considering what to do next, go ahead**.

**Disclaimer: My conclusions drawn from the experience of studies in Brno and FIT FSS MUNI and some 300 interviews with classmates, and (after) college students from Brno, Prague and Liberec. If it's on your school, otherwise, I will be glad for your insight and tips.**
 
The main goal of this post to start disucussion and challange you and your personal experiences.


## 1. Ask someone who did not go to college

I often receive information from parents (Mom has a height), or from teachers on the middle (there have it all). **It's like asking a Christian priest about religion**. Probably he will know a lot about Christianity but Buddhism itself will tell.

This is called [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) - people tend to take the information that supports their own point of view. Watch out for him :)


##2. Find the experienced people in the field that you enjoy

I did this because I did not know anybody like that. Or I did not know it was important. Today I went on Facebook and found a "businessman php programming" and invited the top 3 results for coffee.

### Where to find such people?

For starters probably will not want to pay for a pro order of 1000 CZK. Fortunately, there are cheaper ways:

- [Naučmese](https://www.naucmese.cz/) - the courses you will find a few hundred different people who will gladly tell you about their experiences - alone I met a few interesting people
- **FB groups** - today it's about everything group: programmers, markeťáci, copywriters, business ...
- [Eventigo](https://eventigo.cz/) - a service that free inform the rallies of a particular area (they are usually too free), weekly newsletter I can only recommend




## 3. The amount of the incubator: it gives you the time you could find what you enjoy

Without too much trouble on the high easily you get **3 years time**. Rent and food they will pay the parents will not have three years to do anything. Such early retirement - Take advantage of it and for himself:

- Experiment with different activities in and outside school
- Give each semester **1 course from another field** (somewhere you do not finish it, sometimes it do not even have to register, just go)
- **taste the diversity of habits that will bring peers from other cities or country**
- **take a chance, never failure cheaper** - with a girlfriend, wife, business, contract, full-time work, child or mortgage it will not be free

I took this as I started at an altitude of business. Where I risked the most? **I started to say more about money than peers**. I risked unemployment, but I could be one (it was not, I was terribly scared that I reject). If I had a monthly cost that I pay, I would not have dared. Paradoxical, is not it?

As a result, I learned that **the price of the contract**. How to arrange, such will. When they arrange to CZK 100 / hr., Then so be it. When they arrange to CZK 800 / hr., Then so be it.



### Rest on our laurels

Freshman year you will experience a lot of changes, which you have to devote time and effort. But I still remember it for 3 years - **time is running even if it's well-being, start to do something extra**.


## 4. Keep your school as an option

A lot of my contemporaries devoted 90% of the time school because they did not have significant side interests. 
Unnecessarily.


It's like a work:

This is followed by...
 
 
## 5. The stamps Apply the 80/20 rule, [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
 
- **Abys prošel, stačí 20 % práce**
- **Abys prošel na A, potřebuje 80 % práce.**

- **It passed, just 20% of the work**
- **And he passed on the needs of 80% of the work.**

It took me about 1.5 years before I realized that the sign really nothing about my intelligence, social status and abilities. It's just a number on a test. That's it.

Like IQ is the only indicator of the ability to achieve high scores on IQ tests, the mark is an indicator ability to succeed in this test.

Consider what is important to you and if those 60% of the energy you invest in *raising letters and numbers in a database or in the development itself*.


## 6. Apprenticeship college teachers are not practitioners

What I regret most is that teachers teach at the school. People who stay at the school since his student years. They often have little experience in the art that teaches. How it looked?

The computers did not teach us a man who proposes efficient processors ... The human psyche taught us therapist with 10 years' experience, who has helped hundreds of people ...

... but the professor who writes researches, corrects exam and its main practice is lecturing and conducting seminars.

It all means ...

## 7. Preparation of the know-how-lag


I expected to learn something from the current field, which you want to pay. **Received more education in the history of my field**.

Web technologies were forbidden topic. "It does not matter that PHP runs most of Internet, you will learn the electrical circuitry and programming processors."

This *know-how-lag* is even greater than on primary and secondary school. For current information you need on the Internet, or between people.


## Where are you now?

Write me calmly in the comments if you're in high school, you're thinking about height, height, or you're podnikáš.

Which point he came neujužitečnější? What did you see a completely different way?
