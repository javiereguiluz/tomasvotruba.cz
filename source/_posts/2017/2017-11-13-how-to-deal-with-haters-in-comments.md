title: "How to Deal With Haters in Comments"
perex: '''
    That's what I was asked yesterday for about fifth person already. How do I deal with that when I write an article tweet, just doing good things godly enlightenment, and someone does not like it and throwing dirt on me?

I learned this process while being a maintainer of [ApiGen](/blog/2017/09/04/how-apigen-survived-its-own-death/) for 1 year, where I led dozens of online-hate-wars and found that it leads nowhere. Then I tried another way. Successful.

Today I will try to summarize them in 3 points.


## 1. Process Emotion

Yes, it hurts. When I write a tutorial on how to deal with hater, and someone writes me: *IT'S STUPID* - it hurts. I put so much work in it and instead of a like I get slapped. **In fact, that could be a feedback. With a little effort even constructive.**

What information he or she wants to communicate to me? In 90% of cases:

- "I do not understand that."
- "I understood it differently than you meant."
- "I see it differently."

**I do not respond right away**. When I feel uncomfortable, I'd only return the same emotion and the same would get back.

I take an hour break if you need.


## 2. I'm Interested

I want to know what's on the other's mind. I try to find something useful for me, to make my work better next time.

### How do I respond?

- "It's a total crap '=> What you disagree?
- "That never works" => How do you think it could work?
- "You're doing it wrong" => Why do you think so?

The reaction always depends on the context of the situation. 

In most cases **the reaction to such question is more constructive than the first comment**. And that's enough for me. **I'll take more from it than if I'd remain silent and returned back emotion**.

## 3. I'll Consider if it's Worth it and if so, Iterate

Baby steps. I do not expect that I get positive / pro-growth / sandwich feedback to my first answer - after all, it took me year to get from *that's wrong* to useful and well-accepted feedback. 

Sometimes it takes time, sometimes I regress, but I try to remember the first point. When it doesn't work, I just stop and focus somewhere else.

Often we get from potential argument to his or her new pull-request. And sometimes we stay at *the wrong* :)

**Are you interested on how to reduce the hate-risk already when writing the article, issue or pull-request description?**

Let me know, I might write a follow-up.
